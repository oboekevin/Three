# OcuPhysics
## Summary
The goal of this project is to model various electrically-charged objects and the electric field they generate in 3D using the Oculus Rift. The idea was born out of a difficulty understanding traditional 2D diagrams. Currently, the main application uses Three.js for the graphics and connection to the Oculus. Additionally, it only models point charges, although there are a few smaller side applications that show the electric field around a charged solenoid and the magnetic field around a solenoid with current.
